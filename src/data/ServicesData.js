Solar can reduce diesel consumption by as much as 15% depending on the load-shedding schedule. With 100 square feet of unshaded roof space providing the average of 4 kWh/day, warehouses & Factories will use large and often underutilized rooftop spaces efficiently for clean energy generation. In addition to the energy security during power cuts, the costs are far lower compared to diesel operation, with minimal maintenance.",

Due to the emerging modern world, the car become important for day-to-day transportation hence in our country there is less ground space parking area than number of cars used by our vast population. Besides the problem of space for cars moving on the road, greater is the problem of space for a parked vehicle considering that private vehicles remain parked for most of their time. Multi-level Parking systems is the best space saving parking solution and relief in all major cities in India.",

This system consists of multiple levels of parking spaces stacked on top of each other, which can be accessed using ramps or elevators. The design of a multi-level car parking system can vary depending on the available space and requirements, but generally, it involves a steel or concrete structure that supports the weight of the vehicles and provides safety features such as fire protection, ventilation and security systems."
